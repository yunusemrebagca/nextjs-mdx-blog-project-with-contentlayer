# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a popular programming language that is primarily used for web development. It allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

In this tutorial, we will cover some of the basics of JavaScript programming language.

## Variables

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

```javascript
var name = "John";
let age = 25;
const PI = 3.14;
```

- The `var` keyword is used for declaring variables with function scope.
- The `let` keyword is used for declaring variables with block scope.
- The `const` keyword is used for declaring constants that cannot be reassigned.

## Functions

Functions in JavaScript allow you to group code into reusable blocks. Here's an example of a function that calculates the square of a number:

```javascript
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

You can call this function and store the result in a variable:

```javascript
let result = square(5);
console.log(result); // Output: 25
```

## Control Flow

JavaScript provides various control flow statements, such as conditionals and loops.

### Conditional Statements

You can use \`if\`, \`else if\`, and \`else\` statements to perform different actions based on different conditions:

```javascript
let hour = new Date().getHours();
let greeting;

if (hour < 12) {
  greeting = "Good morning!";
} else if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good afternoon!";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening!";
}

console.log(greeting); // Output depends on the current time
```

### Loops

JavaScript provides different types of loops, such as \`for\` loop, \`while\` loop, and \`do-while\` loop.

Here's an example of a \`for\` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic overview of JavaScript programming language. JavaScript is a versatile language that is widely used in web development and beyond. With this foundation, you can start exploring more advanced concepts and building interactive web applications.

Happy coding!
