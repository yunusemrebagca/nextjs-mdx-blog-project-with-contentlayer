We are going to use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to detect lanes and lane changes in a dashcam video.  
The code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kfirfitousi/LaneDetection), and the result can be seen on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzFcshSwI1E).

## Setup

First, we need a dashcam video to work with. I chose [this one](https://youtu.be/zSY1Ux7UbPU?t=3638) because it features multiple lane changes, both left and right. A frame from the video looks like this:

![Dashcam video frame {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "The first frame of the video" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1461749280684-dccba630e2f6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1169&q=80)

Let's import the necessary libraries, `cv2{:python}` for OpenCV and `numpy{:python}` for working with arrays:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

We're going to need to extract frames from our video and write them to an output video.  
We can do this using the `VideoCapture{:python}` and `VideoWriter{:python}` classes from OpenCV:

```python showLineNumbers
def LaneDetect(input, output="output"):
    # create video capture object
    video = cv2.VideoCapture(input)

    # get video dimensions and framerate
    video_width = int(video.get(3))
    video_height = int(video.get(4))
    video_fps = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)

    # create video writer object
    writer = cv2.VideoWriter(
        output + '.mp4',
        cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'),
        video_fps,
        (video_width, video_height))
```

This creates a capture object that we can use to read frames from the video, and a writer object that we can use to write frames to the output video.  
We want the output video to have the same framerate and dimensions as the input video, so we use the `get{:python}` method to get those values from the capture object and pass them to the writer object.

Now we can loop through the frames of the video, mess around with them, and write them to the output video:

```python showLineNumbers {4,14}
success = True
while success:
    # read frame
    success, frame = video.read()

    # check if frame was read successfully
    if not success:
        break

    # do stuff with frame
    # ...

    # write frame to output video
    writer.write(frame)
```

---

## Preprocessing

To detect the lanes, we are going to use the [Hough Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform), which is a technique for detecting lines in an image. Before using the Hough Transform, it is necessary to preprocess the image.  
Here is our preprocessing code:

```python showLineNumbers
def preprocess(im):
    # make a copy of the image
    res = im.copy()
    # convert to grayscale
    res = cv2.cvtColor(res, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # apply color correction
    res = cv2.convertScaleAbs(res, alpha=1.5, beta=10)
    # apply gaussian blur to smooth out noise
    res = cv2.GaussianBlur(res, (5, 5), 0)
    # find edges using canny edge detection
    res = cv2.Canny(res, 50, 100)
    # isolate the region of interest
    trapezoid = np.array(
        [[(0, 1850), (1350, 1150), (1750, 1150), (3360, 1850)]])
    mask = cv2.fillPoly(np.zeros_like(res), trapezoid, 255)
    res = cv2.bitwise_and(res, mask)

    return res
```

Let's break this down:

1. **Convert to grayscale**: We don't really need the color information of the image. Converting to grayscale reduces the dimensions of the image from 3 to 1 and makes it easier to work with.
2. **Apply color correction**: This is done to make the lines stand out more.
3. **Apply gaussian blur**: This is done to smooth out noise in the image.
4. **Find edges**: We use the Canny edge detection algorithm to find the edges of the lane markings. More information about Canny can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector).
5. **Isolate**: We know that the lane markings are always certain region of the image, so we can isolate this region. We do this by creating a trapezoid mask and applying it to the image.

![Trapezoid mask {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "The region where lane marking are relevant" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684779847639-fbcc5a57dfe9?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

Let’s see how our frame changes with each step:

![Preprocessing steps {{ w: 700, h: 725 }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684779847639-fbcc5a57dfe9?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

In the final step, we can see the edges of the lane markings. Now we can use the Hough Transform to extract their coordinates so we can draw them on the frame.

## Hough Transform

Straight lines are typically represented using the **cartesian coordinate system**. In this system, a line is represented by the equation `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept.
However, this representation has one major drawback: vertical lines have an infinite slope, which means that they cannot be represented by this equation.  
Since we need the ability to detect vertical lines, we have to use a different system.  
The Hough Transform uses the **polar coordinate system** to represent lines. In this system, a line is represented by the equation `ρ = xcosθ + ysinθ`, where `ρ` is the distance from the origin and `θ` is the angle between the `ρ` line and the x-axis (measured in radians).

![Polar coordinate system {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "The polar coordinate system" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684750582572-d69bce90ffa2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

Left lane markings are either vertical or slanted to the right, so in this representation, their **θ** will be between `0` and `7π/18` radians (70 degrees). Right lane markings are either vertical or slanted to the left, so their **θ** will be between `11π/18` radians (110 degrees) and `π` radians (180 degrees).  
The lines with **θ** between `7π/18` and `11π/18` radians are horizontal lines, which are not lane markings and can be ignored.  
We can use this information and the `HoughLines{:python}` function to find the left and right lines in the frame:

```python
left_lines = cv2.HoughLines(
    preprocessed_frame, 1, np.pi/180, 100, max_theta=(7*np.pi)/18)
right_lines = cv2.HoughLines(
    preprocessed_frame, 1, np.pi/180, 100, min_theta=(11*np.pi)/18)
```

We are using the following parameters:

- `rho{:python}` is set to `1` - This is the resolution of the `ρ` parameter. The higher the value, the more accurate the lines will be, but the more lines will be detected.
- `theta{:python}` is set to `π/180` (1 degree) - This is the resolution of the `θ` parameter. The higher the value, the more accurate the lines will be, but the more lines will be detected.
- `threshold{:python}` is set to `100` - This is the minimum number of pixels that need to be on a line for it to be detected.
- `min_theta{:python}` and `max_theta{:python}` - These are the minimum and maximum values of `θ` that we want to detect.

The `HoughLines` function returns a list of lines, each line is a 2d array, and the first element of that array is `[ρ, θ]`.

```python
left_lines = [[[rho1, theta1]], [[rho2, theta2]], ... ]
line = left_lines[0] # first line
line[0][0] # rho of first line
line[0][1] # theta of first line
```

---

## Choosing the Best Lines

At this stage, we may have a long list of lines on each side, or we may have no lines at all.  
If no lines are detected, we can use the previous frame’s lines. Since we know the car isn’t going to move a great distance between frames, the previous frame’s lines are a fairly good estimate – and better than nothing.

```python showLineNumbers
if left_lines is None and len(prev_left_lines) > 0:
    left_lines = np.array([[prev_left_lines[-1][0]]])
# do the same for the right lines
```

If we have a list of lines, we employ the following strategy to choose the best line on each side:

1. We save the previous frame’s lines, and filter our lists to only include lines that are close to those. This helps removing outliers and makes the lines more stable between frames.

```python showLineNumbers
if len(prev_left_lines) > 0:
    close_left_lines = [line for line in left_lines if abs(
        line[0][0] - prev_left_lines[-1][0][0]) < 50 and abs(
            line[0][1] - prev_left_lines[-1][0][1]) < 0.1]
    if len(close_left_lines) > 0:
        left_lines = close_left_lines
# do the same for the right lines
```

Here we are filtering the lines to only include lines with a `ρ` value that is within `50` of the previous frame’s `ρ` value, and a `θ` value that is within `0.1` radians of the previous frame’s `θ` value. We only use this filtered list if it’s not empty.

2. We take the average of the lines. This leaves us with single `ρ` and `θ` values for each side.

```python
left_rho = np.average([line[0][0]
                    for line in left_lines]) if left_lines is not None else 0
left_theta = np.average([line[0][1]
                    for line in left_lines]) if left_lines is not None else 0
# do the same for the right lines
```

---

## Marking the Lanes

Now that we have a line on each side, we can start drawing them on the frame.  
We don't want to draw the lines directly on the frame, because we want to control their opacity. We can do this by creating a new image to draw on, and then use the `addWeighted{:python}` function to add the new frame to the original frame with a specified opacity.

```python
lanes_image = np.zeros_like(frame)
```

This creates a new image that is the same size as the frame, but with all pixels set to black.

Before we can draw our lines, we need to convert them from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates. We can do this using simple trigonometry:

![Polar to cartesian coordinates {{ w: 600, h: 532, cap: "Converting polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684750582572-d69bce90ffa2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

This gives us the coordinates of the line’s origin. We can then extend the line in both directions to cover the entire frame. In this case, we are extending the line 4000 pixels in each direction.

```python
# calculate line coordinates from rho and theta
def get_points(rho, theta):
    a = np.cos(theta)
    b = np.sin(theta)
    x0 = a*rho
    y0 = b*rho
    x1 = int(x0 + 4000*(-b))
    y1 = int(y0 + 4000*(a))
    x2 = int(x0 - 4000*(-b))
    y2 = int(y0 - 4000*(a))

    return x1, y1, x2, y2

x1, y1, x2, y2 = get_points(left_rho, left_theta)
x3, y3, x4, y4 = get_points(right_rho, right_theta)
```

If we were to draw the lines now, they would extend too far and go beyond the road. Here's what it would look like:

![Lane lines extend too far {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Lines extend beyond the road and need to be cropped" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684943210712-7aa4b85b4474?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

To fix this, we crop the top of the lines to a certain `y` value, in this case, `1150`. We also crop the bottom of the lines to the bottom of the frame, which has a `y` value of `2200`.

```python
# crop the top of the lines so they don't extend too far up
if y2 < 1150:
    x2 = int(x2 + (1150-y2) * (x1-x2)/(y1-y2))
    y2 = 1150
if y3 < 1150:
    x3 = int(x3 + (1150-y3) * (x4-x3)/(y4-y3))
    y3 = 1150

# crop the bottom of the lines so they don't extend below the frame
if y1 > 2200:
    x1 = int(x1 + (2200-y1) * (x2-x1)/(y2-y1))
    y1 = 2200
if y4 > 2200:
    x4 = int(x4 + (2200-y4) * (x3-x4)/(y3-y4))
    y4 = 2200
```

Here we are decreasing the `y` value of the top of the lines to `1150` and using the line formula to find the corresponding `x` value. We are also increasing the `y` value of the bottom of the lines to `2200` using the same strategy.

Here is what the lines look like after cropping:

![Cropped lane lines {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Lines are cropped to fit the road" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684943210712-7aa4b85b4474?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

To draw the lines, we use the `line{:python}` function, which takes the image to draw on, the start and end points, the color, and the line width as arguments.

```python
if left_lines is not None:
    cv2.line(lanes_image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (255, 0, 0), 10)
if right_lines is not None:
    cv2.line(lanes_image, (x3, y3), (x4, y4), (255, 0, 0), 10)
```

Next, we want fill the area between the lines. We use the `fillPoly{:python}` function to draw a polygon using the 4 points we calculated earlier.

```python
if left_lines is not None and right_lines is not None:
    points = np.array(
        [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]).reshape((-1, 1, 2))
    cv2.fillPoly(lanes_image, [points], (225, 225, 225))
```

Finally, we use the `addWeighted{:python}` function to add the lanes image on top of the original frame with an opacity of `0.4`.

```python
frame_with_lane_markings = cv2.addWeighted(
    frame, 0.8, lanes_image, 0.4, 0)
```

Here is what the final result looks like:

![Frame with lane markings {{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Frame with lane markings" }}](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684943210712-7aa4b85b4474?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80)

## Lane Change Detection

We want to detect when the car is changing lanes, and to which direction.  
We know that when the car is changing lanes, the `ρ` values of the lines will change. We can take the average left and right `ρ` values from the previous 60 frames, and compare them to the current `ρ` values. If the current `ρ` values are significantly different from the average, we can assume that the car is changing lanes.

```python
left_rho_avg = np.average(
    [line[0][0] for line in prev_left_lines[-60:]]) if len(prev_left_lines) > 0 else 0
right_rho_avg = np.average(
    [line[0][0] for line in prev_right_lanes[-60:]]) if len(prev_right_lanes) > 0 else 0

left_rho_diff = abs(left_rho-left_rho_avg)
right_rho_diff = abs(right_rho-right_rho_avg)
```

But how can we tell wheter the car is changing lanes to the left or to the right?  
We notice that when the car is changing lanes to the left, the `x` value of the bottom of the left line decreases, and when the car is changing lanes to the right, that value increases.  
So, we also need to find the average `x` value of the bottom of the left line, which we called `x1`.

```python
x1_avg = np.average(
    prev_x1_values[-60:]) if len(prev_x1_values) > 0 else 0
```

Now we can detect lane changes and know which direction the car is changing lanes in.

```python
if not lane_change_left and not lane_change_right and len(
            prev_left_lines) > 0 and left_rho_diff > 170 and len(
                prev_right_lanes) > 0 and right_rho_diff > 170:
    # x1 is decreasing when the car is changing lanes to the left
    lane_change_left = x1 < x1_avg
    # x1 is increasing when the car is changing lanes to the right
    lane_change_right = x1 >= x1_avg
    lane_change_frames_shown = 0
    prev_left_lines = []
    prev_right_lanes = []
    prev_x1_values = []
```

We use the value `170` as a threshold for the difference between the current `ρ` values and the average `ρ` values. If the difference is greater than `170`, we assume that the car is changing lanes.  
When a lane change is detected, we discard the previous left and right lines and the previous `x` values, since they are no longer relevant. Also, we reset the `lane_change_frames_shown {:python}` variable, which keeps track of how many frames have passed since the message was displayed.

Finally, we use the `putText{:python}` function to display a message for 60 frames when the car is changing lanes.

```python
if lane_change_right or lane_change_left:
    if lane_change_frames_shown < 60:
        cv2.putText(frame, "Lane Change to Left" if lane_change_left else "Lane Change to Right", (1000, 500),
                    cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 4, (0, 0, 0), 8)
        lane_change_frames_shown += 1
    else:
        lane_change_left = False
        lane_change_right = False
        lane_change_frames_shown = 0
```
