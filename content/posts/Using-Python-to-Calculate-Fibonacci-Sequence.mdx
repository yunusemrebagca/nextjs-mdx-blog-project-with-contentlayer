# Using Python to Calculate Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to calculate the Fibonacci sequence using Python programming language.

Here's a Python function that can be used to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    if n <= 1:
        return fib_sequence[:n+1]

    while len(fib_sequence) <= n:
        next_number = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_number)

    return fib_sequence

# Example usage

n = 10
fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
print(fib_sequence)
```

In this code, we define a function \`fibonacci\` that takes an integer \`n\` as input. We initialize a list \`fib_sequence\` with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.

If \`n\` is less than or equal to 1, we return a slice of \`fib_sequence\` containing the first \`n+1\` terms.

Otherwise, we enter a while loop that continues until the length of \`fib_sequence\` is greater than \`n\`. In each iteration, we calculate the next number in the sequence by summing the last two numbers in \`fib_sequence\` and appending it to the list.

Finally, we return the complete \`fib_sequence\`.

We can test the function by calling it with a specific value of \`n\` and printing the resulting Fibonacci sequence.

Output:

```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
```

By running this code, we obtain the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term.

Now you know how to calculate the Fibonacci sequence using Python! Feel free to explore further and modify the code to suit your needs.
